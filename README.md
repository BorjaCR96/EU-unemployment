***Mumbai-Air-Quality***

**Aim of this project.**

#The aim of this project was to practice working on a database as well as trying to call an API and work with the information got from the API and see if there is a correlation with both databases.#

#In this case we have got a database from kaggle about the air quality of Mumbai, with this database we wanted to see what were the main factors that provoked that air contamination, and compare this data with the one we got in the API of IQAir website.
